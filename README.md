Network Packet Analyzer

## Overview
The Network Packet Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. This project aims to provide insights into network traffic, helping users understand data flow and identify potential issues.

## Features
- **Packet Capture**: Capture packets from specified network interfaces.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyze and decode various network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic in real-time with a user-friendly interface.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter captured packets based on various criteria (protocol type, source/destination IP, etc.).
- **Export Data**: Export captured packets for further analysis in formats like CSV or PCAP.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Scapy**: A powerful Python library for network packet manipulation and analysis.
- **Tkinter**: A library for creating graphical user interfaces (if applicable).
- **Wireshark**: Optional integration for advanced analysis (if applicable).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Network-Packet-Analyzer.git
   cd Network-Packet-Analyzer
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and pip installed, then install the required libraries:



pip install scapy
pip install tkinter  # Only if using a GUI
Run the Program:

python packet_analyzer.py
Usage
